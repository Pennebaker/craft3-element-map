# Element Map

*Element Map* is a Craft CMS plugin that adds an additional widget to the sidebar of full-page element editors. This allows content administrators to see at a glance the relationships between elements.

## Requirements

* Craft CMS 3.0.0-RC1 or above

## Installation

_TODO_

## Usage

When editing an entry, category, or user in the full-page editor, you will be presented a panel in the sidebar with two lists.

1. **References to This Element** lists the elements which contain the currently edited element somewhere in their fields. These elements could be entries, categories, tags, assets, users, or globals.

2. **References to Other Elements** lists the elements which the currently edited element contains somewhere in its fields. These elements could be entries, categories, tags, assets, or users.

Both lists provide links to the related elements editors or control panel sections for quick access.
